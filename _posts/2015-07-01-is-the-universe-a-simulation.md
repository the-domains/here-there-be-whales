    description: 'One hundred years ago, Albert Einstein had only just published his revolutionary new theory of gravity, atomic nuclei were entirely mysterious, and quantum "theory" was a tissue of guesswork. Superconductivity, the nature of the chemical bond, and the energy source of stars were riddles that baffled physics.'

description: "IN Mikhail Bulgakov's novel \"The Master and Margarita,\" the protagonist, a writer, burns a manuscript in a moment of despair, only to find out later from the Devil that \"manuscripts don't burn.\" While you might appreciate this romantic sentiment, there is of course no reason to think that it is true."
